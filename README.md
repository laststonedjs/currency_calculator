# Currency Exchange Calculator

A simple currency exchange calculator built to demonstrate using redux with react hooks.

On this [repo] I am working on an additional practical understanding of the work of "redux" state managament. 
I will use a simple "Currency exchange calculator" application that automatically calculates that value through different currencies upon your input, 
simple UI, clean css/js.
